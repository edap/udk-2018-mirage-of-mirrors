## Apply the camera capture texture to a geometry
In this sketch the texture captured by the camera is applied to an `ofPlanePrimitive`

## Excercises

- Try to make the plane bigger than the texture, or the texture bigger than the plane
- Try to change the value 
- Animate the dimension of the plane, the position and the rotation
- Make a composition using at least 10 planes
